abstract="Slurm is an open source, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable workload manager used on many of the world's supercomputers and computer clusters. As a cluster workload manager, Slurm has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources for some duration of time. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work on the allocated resources. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing queues of pending work and enforcing administrative policies. This paper describes the current design and capabilities of Slurm.",

    abstract = {The introduction of accelerator devices such as graphics processing units (GPUs) has had profound impact on molecular dynamics simulations and has enabled order-of-magnitude performance advances using commodity hardware. To fully reap these benefits, it has been necessary to reformulate some of the most fundamental algorithms, including the Verlet list, pair searching, and cutoffs. Here, we present the heterogeneous parallelization and acceleration design of molecular dynamics implemented in the GROMACS codebase over the last decade. The setup involves a general cluster-based approach to pair lists and non-bonded pair interactions that utilizes both GPU and central processing unit (CPU) single instruction, multiple data acceleration efficiently, including the ability to load-balance tasks between CPUs and GPUs. The algorithm work efficiency is tuned for each type of hardware, and to use accelerators more efficiently, we introduce dual pair lists with rolling pruning updates. Combined with new direct GPU–GPU communication and GPU integration, this enables excellent performance from single GPU simulations through strong scaling across multiple GPUs and efficient multi-node parallelization.},

abstract = {Abstract MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.

  abstract = {We present an efficient method for computing the transition pathways, free energy barriers, and transition rates in complex systems with relatively smooth energy landscapes. The method proceeds by evolving strings, i.e., smooth curves with intrinsic parametrization whose dynamics takes them to the most probable transition path between two metastable regions in configuration space. Free energy barriers and transition rates can then be determined by a standard umbrella sampling around the string. Applications to Lennard-Jones cluster rearrangement and thermally induced switching of a magnetic film are presented.}

The method is based on directly and simultaneously measuring the fluxes through many phase space interfaces and increases the efficiency with at least a factor of 2 with respect to existing transition path sampling rate constant algorithms. The new algorithm is illustrated on the isomerization of a diatomic molecule immersed in a simple fluid.},

  abstract = {In this article, time correlation function methods are used to discuss classical isomerization reactions of small nonrigid molecules in liquid solvents. Molecular expressions are derived for a macroscopic phenomenological rate constant. The form of several of these equations depend upon what ensemble is used when performing averages over initial conditions. All of these formulas, however, reduce to one final physical expression whose value is manifestly independent of ensemble. The validity of the physical expression hinges on a separation of time scales and the plateau value problem. The approximations needed to obtain transition state theory are described and the errors involved are estimated. The coupling of the reaction coordinate to the liquid medium provides the dissipation necessary for the existence of a plateau value for the rate constant, but it also leads to failures of Wigner's fundamental assumption for transition state theory. We predict that for many isomerization reactions, the transmission coefficient will differ significantly from unity and that the difference will be a strong function of the thermodynamic state of the liquid solvent.}

  abstract = {The formulation of the classical barrier-crossing problem is reviewed in the context of numerical simulations, with the focus on barrier crossing problems where the reaction coordinate depends in a non-trivial way on the Cartesian coordinates of many particles. Often it is convenient to measure the barrier height using constrained dynamics. Such a calculation requires a knowledge of the Jacobian for the coordinate transformation between Cartesian and generalized (`reaction') coordinates, and it is shown that the calculation of this Jacobian can be simplified. The conventional expression for the crossing rate is found to become computationally inefficient when the barrier crossing is diffusive. An alternative formulation of the barrier-crossing rate is given that leads to much better statistical accuracy in the computed crossing rates.}

  abstract = {Molecular self-organization driven by concerted many-body interactions produces the ordered structures that define both inanimate and living matter. Here we present an autonomous path sampling algorithm that integrates deep learning and transition path theory to discover the mechanism of molecular self-organization phenomena. The algorithm uses the outcome of newly initiated trajectories to construct, validate and---if needed---update quantitative mechanistic models. Closing the learning cycle, the models guide the sampling to enhance the sampling of rare assembly events. Symbolic regression condenses the learned mechanism into a human-interpretable form in terms of relevant physical observables. Applied to ion association in solution, gas-hydrate crystal formation, polymer folding and membrane-protein assembly, we capture the many-body solvent motions governing the assembly process, identify the variables of classical nucleation theory, uncover the folding mechanism at different levels of resolution and reveal competing assembly pathways. The mechanistic descriptions are transferable across thermodynamic states and chemical space.},
