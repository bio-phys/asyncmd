This file implements commonly used utility functions related to MD usage with asyncmd.

This includes various functions to get all trajectory (or other files) related
to a given engine, naming scheme, and/or file-ending.
It also includes various functions to retrieve or ensure important parameters from
MDConfig/MDEngine combinations, such as nstout_from_mdconfig and ensure_mdconfig_options.
