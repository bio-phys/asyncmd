        time : float or None

        sbatch_options : dict or None
            Dictionary of sbatch options, keys are long names for options,

    Create and submit a SlurmProcess.

    All arguments are directly passed trough to :meth:`SlurmProcess.__init__`
    and :meth:`SlurmProcess.submit`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    jobname : str
        SLURM jobname (``--job-name``).
    sbatch_script : str
        Absolute or relative path to a SLURM submission script.
    workdir : str
        Absolute or relative path to use as working directory.
    time : float or None
        Timelimit for the job in hours. None will result in using the
        default as either specified in the sbatch script or the partition.
    sbatch_options : dict or None
        Dictionary of sbatch options, keys are long names for options,
        values are the correponding values. The keys/long names are given
        without the dashes, e.g. to specify "--mem=1024" the dictionary
        needs to be {"mem": "1024"}. To specify options without values use
        keys with empty strings as values, e.g. to specify "--contiguous"
        the dictionary needs to be {"contiguous": ""}.
        See the SLURM documentation for a full list of sbatch options
        (https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).
    stdfiles_removal : str
        Whether to remove the stdout, stderr (and possibly stdin) files.
        Possible values are:

         - "success": remove on sucessful completion, i.e. zero returncode)
         - "no": never remove
         - "yes"/"always": remove on job completion independent of
           returncode and also when using :meth:`terminate`

    stdin : str or None
        If given it is interpreted as a file to which we connect the batch
        scripts stdin via sbatchs ``--input`` option. This enables sending
        data to the processes stdin via :meth:`communicate`.
        Note that if it is desired to send data to the process the process
        has to be submited with stdin.

    Returns
    -------
    SlurmProcess
        The submitted slurm process instance.

    (Re) initialize all settings relevant for SLURM job control.

    Call this function if you want to change e.g. the path/name of SLURM
    executables. Note that this is a conviencence function to set all SLURM
    settings in one central place and all at once, i.e. calling this function
    will overwrite all previous settings.
    If this is not intended, have a look at the `set_slurm_settings` function
    which only changes the passed arguments or you can also set/modify each
    setting separately in the `SlurmProcess` and `SlurmClusterMediator` classes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sinfo_executable : str, optional
        Name of path to the sinfo executable, by default "sinfo".

        Name or path to the sacct executable, by default "sacct".
    sbatch_executable : str, optional

    scancel_executable : str, optional
        Name or path to the scancel executable, by default "scancel".
    min_time_between_sacct_calls : int, optional
        Minimum time (in seconds) between subsequent sacct calls,
        by default 10.
    num_fails_for_broken_node : int, optional
        Number of failed jobs we need to observe per node before declaring it
        to be broken (and not submitting any more jobs to it), by default 3.
    success_to_fail_ratio : int, optional
        Number of successful jobs we need to observe per node to decrease the
        failed job counter by one, by default 50.
    exclude_nodes : list[str], optional
        List of nodes to exclude in job submissions, by default None, which
