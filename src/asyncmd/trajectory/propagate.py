    Parameters
    ----------
    minus_trajs : list[Trajectory]
        Trajectories that go "backward in time", these are going to be inverted
    minus_state : int
        Index (in ``state_funcs``) of the first state reached on minus trajs.
    plus_trajs : list[Trajectory]
        Trajectories that go "forward in time", these are taken as is.
    plus_state : int
        Index (in ``state_funcs``) of the first state reached on plus trajs.
    state_funcs : list[TrajectoryFunctionWrapper]
        List of wrapped state functions, the indices to the states must match
        the minus and plus state indices!
    tra_out : str
        Absolute or relative path to the output trajectory file.
    struct_out : str, optional
        Absolute or relative path to the output structure file, if None we will
        use the structure file of the first minus_traj, by default None.
    overwrite : bool, optional
        Whether we should overwrite tra_out if it exists, by default False.
